| **Behavior**                                                             | **Input example** | **Output example**       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Radio button Inputs from should take values of numbers or string         | "5","29",6        | True                     |
| Inputs from radio button should only take integers                       | 8,9,"7"           | True or false for string |
| Convert input strings to integers                                        | "5","5","5"       | 5,5,5                    |
| Assign inputs to a variable                                              | var input1=8      | 8                        |
| Create an array to store all the inputs                                  | [4,3,5]           | "4","5","6"              |
| Create a for loop to iterate through the array and add up all the values | 3,7,9             | [19]                     |
| Create a variable to store the total result and assign initial vale to 0 | 2,7,9             | 18                       |
| Displays the Total result on the document                                | 10,0,10,0         | You scored 20/40         |
| Takes inputs and converts the total score into percentage                | 10,0,10,0         | 50%                      |
